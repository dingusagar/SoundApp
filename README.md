# EnhanSound

Basically connect different smartphones via Wi-Fi Direct and play songs across all devices at the same time (with sync), so that the volume gets  amplified (from different speakers). Thereby an attempt to simulate external speakers (or even disrupting them ;). 

We use Network Time Protocol (NTP) for synchronizing the time between the devices.
